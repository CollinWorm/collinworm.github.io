    <h1>Collin Jacques - Professional Portfolio</h1>
    <p>I am a current student enrolled in the University of North Carolina of Wilmington's Full Stack Software Developer program. I am gaining extensive knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Vue.js, SQL, and more!
      This portfolio is a collection of my schoolwork and projects that I have completed during my time in  the program. I am excited to share my work, and update this portfolio as I continue to learn and grow in my career as a software developer.
      I am looking forward to the future and the opportunities that await me. I hope you enjoy my work as much as I enjoyed creating it!</p>
    <p class="disclosure">Disclaimer: This portfolio is a work in progress. I am constantly updating and improving it as I learn new skills and complete new projects, so please check back often for updates! This portfolio is also proudly being built and coded by me all in Visual Studio Code!</p>
